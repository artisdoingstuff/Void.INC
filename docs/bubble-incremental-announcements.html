                I am proud to announce, after over a month's work and plenty of burn out, v1.4.0-beta is out now!<br><br>

                This new version is packed with more new features and many changes to already existing ones.
                However, it is to my utmost disappointment to say that this update will be split into parts, as some planned features are not ready to be released yet.
                But stay tuned! Keep an eye on the <a href="bubble-incremental-roadmap.html">Roadmap</a> to see what's to come in future updates!<br><br>

                If you're interested to read the full changelog, feel free to visit our
                <a href="bubble-incremental-patch-notes.html">Patch Notes</a> page and go through everything this patch has to offer you!<br><br>

                And as always, the releases will always be on our
                <a href="https://github.com/artisdoingstuff/Bubble-Incremental/releases/tag/v1.4.0-beta">GitHub</a>, so what are you waiting for? Go check it out now!<br><br>
                <em>Happy bubbling fellas!</em>
